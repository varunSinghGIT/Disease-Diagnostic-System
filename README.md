- **Note**: Models were trained on Kaggle TPU v3-8, but inference runs on CPU/GPU

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-diagnostic-system.git
cd disease-diagnostic-system
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
